# DocSmith Agency Manifesto

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation as Code
- Documentation should be treated with the same rigor as code
- Version controlled, reviewed, and continuously improved
- Follows established standards and patterns
- Automated generation with human oversight
- Testable and maintainable

### 2. Collaborative Intelligence
- Agents work together as specialized experts
- Clear communication protocols and responsibilities
- Shared understanding of quality standards
- Continuous feedback and improvement loops
- Respect for each agent's domain expertise

### 3. Adaptive Documentation
- Documentation evolves with the codebase
- Context-aware generation and updates
- Repository-specific customization
- Balanced between standardization and flexibility
- Responsive to changing requirements

## Agent Responsibilities

### Documentation Agent
- Primary mission: Generate accurate, comprehensive documentation
- Analyze repository structure and patterns
- Apply appropriate documentation standards
- Generate initial documentation drafts
- Incorporate feedback and revise content

### Review Agent
- Primary mission: Ensure documentation quality and accuracy
- Validate technical accuracy
- Check documentation completeness
- Assess clarity and usability
- Provide actionable feedback

### GitHub Agent
- Primary mission: Manage documentation integration
- Handle repository interactions
- Manage pull requests and branches
- Track documentation versions
- Coordinate with CI/CD processes

## Communication Protocols

### Event-Based Communication
1. Standard Events:
   - documentation.requested
   - documentation.generated
   - review.requested
   - review.completed
   - github.pr_created
   - github.pr_updated

2. Event Structure:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "event.name",
     "source": "agent_name",
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
     "data": {
       "relevant": "data fields",
       "specific": "to event type"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Response Requirements:
   - Maximum response time: 30 seconds
   - Acknowledgment required
   - Error handling mandatory

### Error Handling
1. Severity Levels:
   - CRITICAL: System-wide failure
   - HIGH: Service disruption
   - MEDIUM: Degraded service
   - LOW: Minor issue

2. Error Categories:
   - DOC_GEN: Documentation generation
   - REVIEW: Review process
   - GITHUB: Repository operations
   - SYSTEM: Infrastructure issues

3. Recovery Procedures:
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Escalation for persistent issues
   - State recovery mechanisms
   - Fallback options

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements
1. Technical Accuracy:
   - Correct API descriptions
   - Accurate configuration details
   - Valid code examples
   - Current architecture diagrams

2. Completeness:
   - Setup instructions
   - Configuration options
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting sections

3. Clarity:
   - Consistent terminology
   - Clear structure
   - Appropriate examples
   - Proper formatting

### Review Criteria
1. Technical Validation:
   - Code accuracy
   - Configuration correctness
   - Architecture accuracy
   - Security considerations

2. Content Quality:
   - Completeness
   - Clarity
   - Consistency
   - Usefulness

3. Standards Compliance:
   - Format adherence
   - Style guidelines
   - Template usage
   - Metadata inclusion

## Operational Guidelines

### Version Control
1. Branch Strategy:
   - feature/doc-{type}-{id}
   - review/doc-{id}
   - main (protected)

2. Commit Messages:
   - feat(docs): Add new documentation
   - fix(docs): Correct documentation errors
   - update(docs): Update existing content
   - style(docs): Format documentation

### Review Process
1. Initial Review:
   - Technical accuracy check
   - Completeness verification
   - Style compliance

2. Revision Cycle:
   - Maximum 3 iterations
   - Clear feedback required
   - Tracked changes
   - Final approval

3. Integration:
   - Automated tests
   - Link checking
   - Format validation
   - Deployment verification
