# Error Handling Service

The error handling service helps our system recover from problems and maintain reliability. It catches issues, decides how serious they are, and determines the best way to handle them.

## Types of Errors

### Critical - System Can't Function
- Database connection lost
- API services down
- Configuration missing
Requires immediate attention and automatic alerts.

### High - Major Feature Broken
- Documentation generation fails
- Review system unavailable
- GitHub integration issues
Needs quick attention but system can partially operate.

### Medium - Feature Degraded
- Slow performance
- Minor features unavailable
- Quality checks limited
System works but needs attention soon.

### Low - Minor Issues
- Warning messages
- Non-critical timeouts
- Formatting problems
System works fine but issues should be logged.

## Recovery Strategies

### Automatic Recovery
- Retry failed operations
- Switch to backup services
- Clear stuck processes
System tries to fix itself first.

### Graceful Degradation
- Disable problematic features
- Use simpler alternatives
- Continue with limited function
Keep working even with problems.

### Manual Intervention
- Alert administrators
- Document error context
- Suggest recovery steps
When automatic recovery isn't possible.

## Common Scenarios

### API Problems
1. Detect failed requests
2. Try again carefully
3. Use cached data if possible
4. Alert if persistent

### Processing Errors
1. Save partial progress
2. Clean up resources
3. Retry from last good state
4. Report if unsuccessful

### Resource Issues
1. Free unused resources
2. Scale down operations
3. Prioritize critical tasks
4. Recover gradually
