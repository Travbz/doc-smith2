# Rate Limiting Service

The rate limiting service prevents overload by controlling how quickly we make requests to external services. It's like a traffic light that ensures smooth flow by managing when requests can proceed.

## What Gets Limited

### GitHub API Requests
- Repository operations
- PR management
- Comment handling
Stays within GitHub's allowed limits.

### OpenAI API Usage 
- Token consumption
- Request frequency
- Model calls
Manages both cost and capacity.

### Internal Services
- Documentation generation
- Quality analysis
- Review processes
Prevents system overload.

## How Limiting Works

### Request Windows
Each minute, we track:
- Number of requests made
- Tokens consumed
- API calls sent

When we hit limits, requests wait for the next window.

### Priority System
1. Critical operations (error fixes)
2. User-triggered actions
3. Automated processes
4. Background tasks

### Backoff Strategy
If services are busy:
1. First try: Wait briefly
2. Second try: Wait longer
3. Further tries: Increase wait time
4. Eventually: Give up gracefully

## Common Scenarios

### Normal Operation
- Requests flow smoothly
- No waiting needed
- Even distribution

### High Load
- Requests get queued
- Priority items go first
- Others wait their turn

### Recovery
- System catches up
- Backlog clears
- Normal flow resumes

## Best Practices

### Efficient Usage
- Batch similar requests
- Share cached results
- Plan request timing

### Handling Limits
- Watch for warnings
- Handle gracefully
- Inform users

### Monitoring
- Track usage patterns
- Adjust limits as needed
- Plan for growth
