# Queue Service

The queue service manages and prioritizes work across the system. Like a well-organized todo list, it ensures tasks get done in the right order and nothing gets forgotten.

## How Tasks Flow

### Adding Tasks
1. Task arrives (like new docs to review)
2. Gets priority assigned
3. Added to appropriate queue
4. Workers notified

### Processing Tasks
1. Workers check for tasks
2. Pick highest priority first
3. Process the task
4. Report completion

### When Things Go Wrong
1. Error detected
2. Task paused
3. Retry if possible
4. Move on if needed

## Task Priorities

### Urgent (Critical)
- Error recovery
- User-waiting tasks
- System stability issues
Handle immediately.

### High Priority
- Documentation generation
- Initial reviews
- PR creation
Process as soon as possible.

### Normal Priority
- Quality checks
- Documentation updates
- Review responses
Standard processing order.

### Background
- Cleanup tasks
- Cache updates
- Status checks
Do when system is quiet.

## Common Scenarios

### Documentation Flow
1. New repo arrives
2. Analysis queued urgent

4. Review queued normal

### Review Process
1. Quality check queued high
2. Feedback processing normal
3. Updates queued normal
4. Final review high

### GitHub Integration
1. PR creation normal
2. Comment handling background
3. Merge requests high
4. Cleanup background
